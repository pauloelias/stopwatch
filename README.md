# StopWatch

A simple StopWatch react app that uses refs to “send a message” within React components.

Intended to be super simple without any design or styling for now. This is just a small app to help me understand basics of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

## Setup

To view the app you need to:

1. Download the files or clone the repo
2. Change to the “stopwatch” directory `$ cd stopwatch`
3. Start a local web server and visit the page in your browser

### Serve Project

To start a server locally you can install [NPM’s handy “serve” module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)

```
$ npm install serve -g
```

Start the server and open the page in your default browser:

```
open http://localhost:8000 && serve -p 8000
```


## Credits

The idea for this app came from the [“Laracasts: Do You React?”](https://laracasts.com/series/do-you-react/) series.
